                    <h1>Projects</h1>
                    <p>During my time at OU, I was able to make some pretty cool things while working on my projects for my MIS classes. Here are some of my favorite projects I have completed in my Business Programming languages class. A complete list of my work can be found on my Github, which is linked in the "Social Media" tab in the navbar.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><h2>Pokemon JSON:</h2> When learnign how to implament and convert JSON databeses into our C# code, we were tasked with creating a searchable index of pokemon that would list their names in a dropdown menu, as well as show their height, weight, and their sprite whenever you click on the pokemon</li>
                        <li><h2>Tic-Tac-Toe:</h2> The Tic-Tac-Toe project was my midterm and was easily one of the most difficult and annoying projects I have had to work on, but at the same time the most rewarding. I was tasked with creating a playable Tic-Tac-Toe game within a WPF application. I needed to incorporate a JSON database for the rules, differenct classes to use within my main window, and various WPF controls to ensure that my game played correctly and there were no bugs. This project ended up taking me until 4am the day of to finish, but when I finally had everythign working the way I wanted it to, it was an amazing feeling to know that I struggled, but in the end it was all worth it because I had my game working the way I wanted it to.</li>
                        <li><h2>FizzBuzz:</h2> While this is one of the easiest project I have ever done, it was still very impactful to me. When I was tasked with the FizzBuzz project, I was told that this is something that many employers will ask you to do in the interview as a test of basic C# knowledge. Granted, this project still took me quite awhile to complete, but when I finished it made me feel prepared and confident to start applying for jobs. I remmeber thinking to myself "If they want to see FizzBuzz, just wait until they see all of the other projects I can do!"</li>
